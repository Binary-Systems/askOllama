Arg: Russia

The first President of Russia was Boris Yeltsin, who served from June 12, 1990 to December 31, 1999. However, if you're asking about the first head of state after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, that would be Boris Yeltsin as well.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: China

China has a complex and evolving system of government, but I'll provide some context.

China is currently a one-party state with a Communist Party-led government. The country has had various leaders throughout its history, but here are a few key ones:

* **Chairman Mao Zedong** (1949-1976): He was the founding father of the People's Republic of China and served as Chairman of the Communist Party from 1943 until his death in 1976.
* **Deng Xiaoping** (1977-1992): Often referred to as "the architect of modern China," Deng implemented market-oriented economic reforms that transformed China into a major economic power.

However, if you're looking for a president-like figure, the answer is:

* None! In China's current system, there is no president in the classical sense. Instead, the country has had several leaders with varying titles and roles:
	+ **Li Xiannian** (1983-1992): He was the last Chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC), which serves as China's legislature.
	+ **Jiang Zemin** (1993-2003): He was General Secretary of the Communist Party of China from 1989 to 2002 and President of the PRC from 1993 to 2003, although his presidency was largely ceremonial.
	+ **Hu Jintao** (2003-2013) and later **Xi Jinping** (2013-present): These leaders have held various titles, including General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the NPC.

China's government structure is complex and has evolved over time. If you're interested in learning more, feel free to ask!

Arg: Canada

The first prime minister of Canada, not president (note: Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system and a monarch as head of state), was Sir John A. Macdonald. He served from 1867 to 1873.

However, if you're interested in learning more about the Canadian confederation and its early leaders, here's some info:

* The British North America Act (BNA Act) created the Dominion of Canada on July 1, 1867.
* Sir John A. Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of Canada, serving from July 1, 1867, to November 5, 1873.

Canada has had 23 prime ministers since its confederation, but only one monarch (Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III as his successor).

Arg: Japan

Japan does not have a President. Japan is a constitutional monarchy, with a parliamentary democracy system. The head of state and government is the Emperor (currently Naruhito), but the actual governing power rests with the Prime Minister.

However, if you're interested in knowing who was the first Prime Minister of Japan, it would be H. Itō Hirobumi (also known as Hirofumi Itō), who served from December 1885 to January 1888.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Venezuala

The first president of Venezuela was José Antonio Páez, who served as president from 1830 to 1835. However, if you're referring to the modern democratic era that began after the death of Simón Bolívar in 1830, the first president was actually:

* Andrés Narváez (1831) - Although he didn't complete his term due to a coup.
* José Antonio Páez (1835) - As I mentioned earlier, but only served for about two months.

The longest-serving and most influential leader of Venezuela during its early years of independence was Simón Bolívar's right-hand man, however, the country had many presidents before the "first" modern president.
