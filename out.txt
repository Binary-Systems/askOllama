Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Russia

The first President of Russia was Boris Yeltsin, who served from June 1990 to December 1999. However, this might be a bit confusing since Russia had previously been part of the Soviet Union.

If you're asking about the first President of modern-day Russia (i.e., after the dissolution of the Soviet Union), it's Boris Yeltsin again.

However, if you'd like to know who was considered the "first leader" of Russia in a broader sense, that would be:

* Peter the Great (1672-1725): Considered one of the greatest leaders in Russian history, he expanded Russia's borders, established the city of St. Petersburg, and modernized the country.
* Catherine the Great (1729-1796): Another prominent leader who ruled Russia from 1762 to 1796, expanding its territories and establishing it as a major European power.

Please note that these were monarchs, not presidents.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: China

China has a complex and evolving system of government, and it's not straightforward to identify a single "first president" in the way that might be understood for other countries.

However, I can provide some context and historical information:

* The Republic of China (ROC) was founded on January 1, 1912, with Sun Yat-sen as its first provisional president.
* In 1949, the Communist Party of China (CPC) took power, and Mao Zedong became the chairman of the People's Government of China. However, in 1954, the PRC was officially established, and Liu Shaoqi became the chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), which is the highest state body in China.
* In 1975, Hua Guofeng became the chairman of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the premier of the State Council. This marked a period of transition following Mao Zedong's death.

In modern times, the head of the PRC is represented by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (currently Xi Jinping). However, there is no single "president" in the Western sense, as that role has evolved over time and is still considered to be held by the General Secretary.

So, while it's difficult to pinpoint a single "first president" for modern-day China, I can highlight some key figures:

* Sun Yat-sen (provisional president of the ROC, 1912)
* Mao Zedong (chairman of the People's Government of China, 1949-1976)
* Liu Shaoqi (chairmen of the Standing Committee of the NPC, 1954-1968)

Please keep in mind that these individuals played important roles in shaping modern China, but their positions and titles have evolved over time.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Canada

The United States and Canada are two separate countries with their own histories, governments, and institutions.

If you're asking about the current head of government in Canada:

* The Prime Minister of Canada is the chief executive of the federal government. The current Prime Minister of Canada (as of 2021) is Justin Trudeau.

However, if you're asking about the first "head of state" or leader of a newly-formed country, the answer would be different.

For example:

* In Canada's case, as a British colony, it was initially governed by governors and later lieutenant-governors appointed by the British monarch. The British government also had control over Canadian foreign policy during this period.
* However, if you're asking about the first Prime Minister of what is now modern-day Canada, after it gained dominion status in 1867, that would be Sir John A. Macdonald.

Let me know how I can help further clarify!

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Japan

Japan does not have a president. It has an Emperor, who serves as the head of state and symbol of national identity. The current Emperor of Japan is Naruhito.

However, if you're looking for the first prime minister of Japan (who is the head of government), it was Hiranuma Kiichirō in 1885, but he didn't last long. The first prime minister who actually held significant power and set up the modern system of government in Japan was Yamagata Aritomo, who served from 1898 to 1901.

The first president of Venezuela was José Antonio Páez, but he served as a military leader and interim president during the Gran Colombia period (1819-1821) and later became one of the first presidents of an independent Venezuela in 1830.

However, if you are referring to the country's first president after gaining independence from Gran Colombia, that would be José Antonio Páez himself, who served as President of Venezuela from 1830 to 1835.
