- Boris Yeltsin’s election marked the first time the Russian Federation had a directly elected president, setting a new precedent for executive leadership in the country.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Canada

**Canada**

Canada has never had a *president* because it is a constitutional monarchy, not a republic.  
The country’s head of state is the monarch of the United Kingdom, represented in Canada by a Governor General. The first person to hold the post of Governor General at Confederation was:

- **Henry Petty‑Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne** (appointed 1 July 1867)

The first person to head Canada’s government (Prime Minister) was:

- **Sir John A. Macdonald** (in office 1 July 1867 – 6 June 1873)

So, in short, **there is no “first president” of Canada**—the country has been led by a monarch/representative and a prime minister.

  - The most recent United Nations and World Bank estimates put Canada’s population at roughly 38.1 million as of mid‑2023, with a growth rate of about 0.7 % per year.  

**Quick Context**

| Source | Latest Estimate | Year |

| United Nations (World Population Prospects, 2024) | 38,000,000 | 2023 |
| World Bank | 38,056,000 | 2023 |
| Statistics Canada | 38,000,000 | 2023 |

These figures include all residents (citizens, permanent residents, and temporary foreign nationals) residing in Canada’s 10 provinces and 3 territories. The population is highly concentrated in a few major urban centers: Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, and Edmonton.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Japan

**Japan – no president**

Japan is a constitutional monarchy, so it has never had a position titled “President.”  
The head of state is the **Emperor**, and the head of government is the **Prime Minister**.

* **First Emperor of the modern era** – **Emperor Meiji** (reigned 1867‑1912).  
* **First Prime Minister of Japan** – **Itō Hirobumi** (served 1885‑1888, with later terms).

So, if you’re looking for the first person in a top executive role in Japan, it’s Itō Hirobumi (as Prime Minister); there has never been a president.

- Venezuela’s population has fluctuated in recent years due to migration, but the figure above reflects a 2023–2024 snapshot, with a slight decline compared to 2019 levels (~29 million).  
- Urban areas (e.g., Caracas, Maracaibo, Valencia) house the majority of the population, while rural and frontier regions remain sparsely populated.
