Arg: Peru

**Peru – First President**

- **Name:** **José de la Riva‑Agüero**  
- **Term in Office:** 28 August 1823 – 12 March 1824  
- **Background:** Riva‑Agüero was a lawyer and political figure who was elected by the Congress of Peru to serve as its first constitutional president after the country’s declaration of independence from Spain in 1821. His brief presidency (lasting about six months) was marked by political instability and the early challenges of establishing a new republic. He was the first person to hold the office of President of Peru in the modern sense, preceding the subsequent provisional governments and leaders that followed in the turbulent early years of the nation.

Arg: China

**China**

| State | First President (official title) | Term | Notes |
|-------|-----------------------------------|------|-------|
| **Republic of China** (1912‑1949) | **Sun Yat‑sen** (acting) | 1 January 1912 – 12 February 1912 (first provisional president) | Sun served as provisional president before the National Assembly elected Yuan Shikai; he is widely recognized as the founding father of modern China. |
| **People’s Republic of China** (1949‑present) | **Mao Zedong** | 1 October 1954 – 12 September 1959 | The office of “President of the People’s Republic of China” was established in 1954; Mao was the first holder of that title, while he had already been Chairman of the Communist Party since 1949. |

So the **first presidents** are **Sun Yat‑sen** for the Republic of China and **Mao Zedong** for the People’s Republic of China.
############
Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Canada

**Canada does not have a president.**

- **Head of state**: The British monarch (currently King Charles III), represented in Canada by a *Governor General*.
- **First Governor General** (the monarch’s representative and the closest thing Canada has to a “president” of the state): **Prince Albert Edward**, later King Edward VII, who served from 1867 to 1872.
- **First Prime Minister** (head of government): **Sir John A. Macdonald** (1867–1873).

So while Canada is a parliamentary democracy with a prime minister, it has never had a presidential office.
############
Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Japan

**Japan – No President**

Japan has never had a head of state titled “President.” The modern Japanese government is a constitutional monarchy, and the Emperor (currently Emperor Naruhito) is the ceremonial head of state. The political leadership is carried out by the **Prime Minister**.

- **First Prime Minister of Japan:** **Itō Hirobumi** (served 1885–1888, 1892–1896, 1898–1900, 1901–1906).

So, in short, Japan does **not** have a first president.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Venezuala

**First president of Venezuela**

- **Juan de la Cruz** – He was elected as the first President of the Republic of Venezuela in the 1811 Constitution (the first constitution of an independent Venezuela).  
  - **Term:** 1811 – 1812 (his government was short‑lived due to the political turbulence of the early independence period).  

*Note:*  
In 1830, when the Venezuelan Republic was formally organized under a new constitution, the first president under that system was **José Antonio Páez** (1830‑1835). However, the very first person to hold the office of president in an independent Venezuelan state was Juan de la Cruz.

Prompt: What is the approximate population of each country?
Arg: Costa Rica

**Costa Rica – Approximate Population (2024)**  

| Year | Source | Estimated Population |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| 2023 | World Bank / UN World Population Prospects (mid‑year estimate) | **≈ 5,110,000** |
| 2024 | World Bank / UN World Population Prospects (mid‑year estimate) | **≈ 5,120,000** (projected) |

**Key Points**

- Costa Rica’s population has been growing steadily at roughly 1 % per year over the last decade, mainly due to natural increase (births > deaths).  
- The country has a fairly even gender split (≈ 50.5 % female, 49.5 % male).  
- Urbanization is high: about 80 % of residents live in urban areas, with the capital San José and the metropolitan region accounting for roughly 40 % of the total population.  
- The population is relatively young, with a median age of ~30 years, and the age distribution is shifting slightly toward an older demographic as life expectancy rises.

| 2022 | **≈ 33 million** | World Bank, UN |
| 2021 | **≈ 32.5 million** | World Bank |

**Key Points**

- Peru’s population is roughly 33 million people, making it the 12th‑largest country in South America by population.
- The population growth rate has slowed to about 0.8 % per year in recent years, largely due to declining fertility rates and continued urban migration.
- The majority of Peruvians live in the coastal regions (especially Lima), with significant populations in the highlands (Andes) and, to a lesser extent, the Amazon basin.

| **Population density** | ≈ 4 people/km² | Very low density due to large uninhabited areas. |
| **Urban share** | ≈ 82 % | Most residents live in urban centres. |

| Year (est.) | Population |
|-------------|------------|

> *Sources*: United Nations World Population Prospects 2023, World Bank population estimates, and Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (Statistics Bureau).  

**Key Points**

- Japan’s population has been gradually declining since its peak (~126 million in 2011) due to a low birth rate and high life expectancy.  
- The country has an aging population; roughly 28 % are aged 65 + as of 2023.  
- Migration inflows are modest, so natural change (births minus deaths) drives most fluctuations.

Arg: Venezuala

**Venezuela**

| Metric | Approximate value (latest reliable estimate) |

**Key points**

- The figure comes from the World Bank’s “Population, total” series (2023) and is consistent with UN World Population Prospects 2023 projections.  
- Venezuela’s population has been relatively stable since the early 2000s, with modest growth (~0.3 % per year).  
- Recent years have seen significant out‑migration (especially after the economic crisis began around 2015), which can slightly lower the effective resident population compared to the official count.
