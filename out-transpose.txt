Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Costa Rica

The first President of Costa Rica was José María Castro Madriz, who served from 1848 to 1849. However, the first constitutional president of Costa Rica was José María Montealegre Fernández, who served in 1859.

It's worth noting that Costa Rica had a complex and tumultuous early history, with multiple attempts at establishing a republic and several brief presidencies between 1821 and 1848. Castro Madriz is often considered the first president of a more formalized government, but the distinction can be somewhat nuanced depending on how one views the country's early history.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Russia

The first leader or "president" of modern Russia, in its current form as a federal republic, is Boris Yeltsin. However, he was not the first head of state after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

To clarify:

* The last leader of the Soviet Union (USSR), which included Russia among 14 other Soviet Socialist Republics, was Mikhail Gorbachev.
* After the dissolution of the USSR on December 26, 1991, Boris Yeltsin became the first president of the Russian Federation, serving from June 12, 1990, to December 31, 1999.

If you're interested in knowing about earlier leaders in Russia's history, there have been many notable figures throughout its centuries-long past, including:

* Peter the Great (ruled 1682-1725), a significant reformer who transformed Russia into a major European power.
* Catherine the Great (ruled 1762-1796), known for her extensive cultural and territorial accomplishments.

However, to answer your question directly: Boris Yeltsin is the first president of modern-day Russia in its current form as the Russian Federation.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: China

China has a complex and sometimes confusing system of governance, but I'll try to provide a clear answer.

The People's Republic of China (PRC) was established in 1949, after a long civil war. The first leader of the PRC was:

* Mao Zedong (also known as Chairman Mao) - he served as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China and the head of state from 1949 to 1976.

However, if you're referring to the President of the Republic of China (ROC), which is a separate entity that governs Taiwan, then:

* Sun Yat-sen was one of the founders of the ROC, but he didn't serve as president. The first president of the ROC was:
	+ Yuan Shikai (1912-1916)
	+ Later, after Sun's death, the Kuomintang (KMT) took control of the government, and Chiang Kai-shek served as the President of the Republic of China from 1928 to 1949.

Canada does not have a president, but rather a monarch (currently King Charles III) as its head of state. However, the role of representative for the monarch in Canada is fulfilled by the Governor General of Canada.

That being said, if you're looking for the first Prime Minister of Canada (who holds more executive power and authority), it was Sir John A. Macdonald. He served as the first Prime Minister from 1867 to 1873.

Japan has never had a president. It has been an imperial monarchy since its establishment, with the Emperor serving as the head of state and symbol of national unity.

However, I can tell you that the current monarch (Emperor) of Japan is Naruhito, who has reigned since 2019. His father, Akihito, was the previous Emperor from 1989 to 2019.

If you're looking for the first modern head of state in Japan, it would be Meiji (1852-1912), who served as Emperor from 1867 until his death in 1912.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: Venezuala

The first president of Venezuela was José María Vargas (1831) but he served as the president of the Congress, not the country. The actual first president of Venezuela's history is a matter of debate among historians.

However, if we consider the First Venezuelan Republic that existed from 1810 to 1812, then the first leader of Venezuela was Francisco de Miranda, who served as the President of the Council of Government in 1811.

But if we are talking about the modern-day republic of Venezuela, established on March 9, 1829, then the first president was:

* José María Vargas (1831), but he wasn't directly elected. He took over after a series of short-lived governments.
* However, the first president to be directly elected and considered one of the most important figures in Venezuelan history is:
	+ José Gregorio Monagas, who served as the President of Venezuela from 1855 to 1858.

So, while there are different answers depending on how you look at it, I'd say that José María Vargas (1831) or José Gregorio Monagas (1855-1858) could be considered among the first presidents of Venezuela.

Prior to Yeltsin's presidency, Mikhail Gorbachev was the last General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a position that effectively made him the head of state for the entire Soviet Union.

Prompt: Who is the first president of each country?
Arg: China

China has a complex and nuanced history, but I'll try to provide an accurate answer.

In China, there have been several dynasties throughout its long history. If we consider the modern Republic of China (1912-1949), the last imperial dynasty was the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).

However, in 1912, the Republic of China was established with Sun Yat-sen as the first President. He served from January 1, 1912, to March 12, 1912.

If we consider the People's Republic of China, which was established on October 1, 1949, after the Chinese Civil War, there has never been a single president or a traditional presidential system like in Western countries. The Communist Party of China (CPC) has always maintained control through its Politburo and General Secretary.

Mao Zedong served as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China from 1943 to 1976 and held other key positions, but not as president in the classical sense. After Mao's death, Hua Guofeng became acting chairman (from April 2, 1976, to July 18, 1981), followed by Hu Yaobang as General Secretary of the CPC.

However, if we consider a more modern, non-dynastic perspective on China, Deng Xiaoping is often regarded as the "paramount leader" and the person who shaped China's economic reforms. While not officially president, he held significant influence over Chinese politics from 1978 to 1992.

Unfortunately, Canada has a constitutional monarchy system with a parliamentary government. As such, it doesn't have a president in the classical sense. Instead, the monarch (currently King Charles III) serves as head of state, represented by the Governor General.

However, if you're looking for a head of state who serves as a ceremonial or symbolic leader, you might be thinking of Pierre Trudeau's successor, Jean Chrétien, is not correct either...

But, in 1984, Canada did adopt an amendment to the Constitution that created the position of the "Prime Minister" (which is a bit different from the US President). However, if we're looking for someone who was the first "head of state", albeit with limited powers compared to a president, then I'd say the answer would be Pierre Trudeau's predecessor as Prime Minister.

So, George Brown in 1867 and Sir John A. Macdonald in 1867 (co-founder of the Liberal party, along with George Brown) were co-founders of the country as we know it today, however, if you want the title to match, and more modern significance in Canadian history...

The answer is actually Pierre Trudeau, but he wasn't a president...

The first president of Venezuela was José Antonio Páez. He served as president three times: from 1830 to 1835, from 1839 to 1843, and from 1861 to 1863. However, if you are referring to the most recent period since the country's independence in 1811, then the first president of Venezuela was actually José María Vargas' successor, who was:

José María Vargas was briefly president after Simón Bolívar stepped down as dictator and before the Venezuelan Congress elected him president again. However, it is generally considered that the first constitutional president after independence was:

Simón Bolívar (though he stepped down for a brief period to be succeeded by José María Vargas)

But if we are considering a non-dictatorial president who was democratically elected in the post-independence era, then:

* Simón Bolívar became the first president of Venezuela under a newly created Venezuelan Republic's congress that was established after he stepped down. He later stepped back and was replaced briefly by 
  José María Vargas (1831)
